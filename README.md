Project: AniDex

# Introduction
AniDex is an AR application for all ages, especially kids. AniDex aims for everyone to know more about animals, see realistic animals through screens in this social distance period where zoos are not open. AniDex is also an entertaining application where you are able to selfie with funny animal faces and play game in the real world.

# Ideas
Visualization in education is always necessary, especially for children in the work of exploring their world. Among those topics, discovering animals, insects is a big one. Going to the zoo is a good way, but how about bringing all the things to the children's room? The children will have chances to know more about animals as well as the specific animal's habitats. Furthermore, they can control their favourite virtual pets to run around the room, enjoy the fun time with their parents.
