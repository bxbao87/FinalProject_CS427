									Hare
									
General: Hares and jackrabbits are leporids belonging to the genus Lepus. Hares are classified in the same family as rabbits.

Location: Hare species are native to Africa, Eurasia, and North America.

Appearance: These animals have a rather distinctive appearance characterized by their extremely long ears, long hind legs, short snout, big eyes, and stout body. They are typically adorned with white, black, gray, tan, or reddish-orange colors to blend in with the surroundings. Some species turn white during the winter months or remain white all year long as a form of camouflage in the snow. In order to change color, these hares molt in the spring.

reproduction: The mating system of the hare has been described as both polygynous (single males mating with multiple females) and promiscuous. Females have six-weekly reproductive cycles and are receptive for only a few hours at a time, making competition among local bucks intense.

Eating: Hares eat leaves, buds, roots, berries, fungi, bark, and twigs. They eat their food twice. Like rabbits, hares produce two types of droppings.

Life: not like general rabbit, hare live solitarily or in pairs. They do not dig burrows, but nest in slight depressions called forms, often in long grass. Hare likes to eat hard things like twigs or bark while Rabbit likes to eat grass, soft stalks and vegetables.
