									Stag
									
General: stag or true stag are hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. 

Location: stag are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native stag.

Appearance: stag are lean, long-legged mammals. Their typical coloring ranges from reddish-brown to gray-brown with cream-colored undersides. Male stag may also be identified by their impressive antlers. These large pests stand three feet tall at the shoulder and approximately six feet long from nose to tail. Graceful and fast, stag are timid around humans. People appreciate these animals' beauty and gentle nature, but are aggravated by their tendency to eat garden and landscape plants.

reproduction: There may be several more matings before the stag will seek out another mate in his harem. Females in their second autumn can produce one or very rarely two offspring per year. The gestation period is 240 to 262 days, and the offspring weigh about 15 kg (33 lb).

Life: Large stag populations near people lead to roadway accidents. The pests' skittishness causes them to take off in unpredictable directions, leaving drivers with only seconds to respond. Collisions with stag cause major damage to vehicles and can be fatal to people. In addition, the pests carry black-legged ticks. These parasites are vectors for Lyme disease, an illness that can lead to serious neurological problems and heart damage. Yard and plant damage are also caused by stag, as they feed on young vegetation. Critter Control can assist in identifying and excluding stag from vulnerable properties.
